# serviciosmultiples
Fullstack project
Main Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to enhance my backend skills by developing a .NET Web API to integrate with a frontend built using Astro and React. I implemented a microservices architecture and adhered to SOLID principles for the backend. For image handling, I enabled file uploads to https://imgbb.com/ and stored the URLs in the database, while also allowing for direct image uploads.
